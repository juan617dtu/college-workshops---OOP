Dine-In Digital - A Restaurant Ordering System

an application that enables waiters to take customer orders for food and drinks and generate a bill upon order completion. 
Each bill will be numbered, and after an order is finalized, a copy of the bill will be saved in a separate file titled with the 
corresponding bill number.
