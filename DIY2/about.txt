Creation of a module that can represent a file on the hard disk containing comma-separated numbers.

This module is able to load the numbers and perform the following tasks.

-An object is able to display the numbers in a tabular format on ostream in a specified number of columns, column width and precision.
-An object is able to display the numbers that fall within a specific range and the number of their occurrence.
-An object is able to sort the numbers in an ascending or descending order.
-Copying an object is done safely and doing so also copies the data file on the hard disk. 
The new file name is the same as the original file with an added "C_" prefix.
-Assigning an object to another is done safely and the content of the target file is overwritten by the source file.
-An object also makes the numbers available to the user program by indexing like an array.
-An object is able to receive the data file name from the istream and load the data from the file on the hard drive.
